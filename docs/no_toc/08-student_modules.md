## Student Account Setup
 
:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

In order to run your analyses, you will use the [AnVIL cloud computing platform](https://anvilproject.org/).  The AnVIL (Analysis Visualization and Informatics Lab-space) platform is specially designed for analyzing biological data, and is used by scientists doing all sorts of biological research.

:::{.notice}
**AnVIL in a nutshell**

- Behind the scenes, AnVIL relies on Google Cloud Platform to provide computing infrastructure.  Basically, AnVIL lets you "rent" computers through the internet. The analysis is run on the rented computer. AnVIL lets you see the results in your browser.
- AnVIL uses [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/) to provide many computational tools useful for biological data analysis, such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/), and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).  Terra takes care of installing these tools so you can use them right away.
:::

### Create Google Account

First, you will need to set up a (free) Google account.

A Google account usually looks like "`myname@gmail.com`". Alternatively, you can enable Google for an existing non-Gmail email address using [these instructions](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029186611).

If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing AnVIL, [create one now](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).

### Log In to Terra

Next, make sure you can log in to Terra -- you will use Terra to perform computations on AnVIL. 

You can access Terra by going to [`anvil.terra.bio`](https://anvil.terra.bio/). Open Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account.

### Share Username

Make sure your instructor has your Google account username (e.g. `myname@gmail.com`), so they can give you access to everything you need.

- Make sure there are no typos!
- If you have multiple Google accounts, make sure you give them the username that you will be using to log in to `anvil.terra.bio`.

:::{.warning}
It is *very important* that you share the Google account you will be using to access AnVIL with with your instructor! Otherwise, the instructor cannot add you to Billing Projects or Workspaces, and you will be unable to proceed with your assignments.

## Student instructions for cloning a Workspace

These instructions can be customized to a specific workspace by setting certain variables before running `cow::borrow_chapter()`.  If these variables have not been set, reasonable defaults are provided (e.g. "ask your instructor").

### With no variables set:

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

:::{.warning}
This **will not work** until your instructor has given you permission to spend money to "rent" the computers that will power your analyses (by adding you to a "Billing Project").
:::

On AnVIL, you access files and computers through **Workspaces**.  Each Workspace functions almost like a mini code laboratory - it is a place where data can be examined, stored, and analyzed. The first thing we want to do is to copy or “clone” a Workspace to create a space for you to experiment.  This will give you access to

- the files you will need (data, code)
- the computing environment you will use

:::{.notice}
**Tip**
At this point, it might make things easier to open up a new window in your browser and split your screen. That way, you can follow along with this guide on one side and execute the steps on the other.

## Student instructions for launching Jupyter

The module below is specially customized for students, allowing you to give more specific instructions on the settings for their Jupyter environment.  There are several other general purpose modules that may also be useful for students (e.g. Pausing Jupyter, Deleting Jupyter) that can be found in other chapters of this book.

The following instructions can be customized by setting certain variables before running `cow::borrow_chapter()`. Developers should create these variables as a list `AnVIL_module_settings`. The following variables can be provided:

- `audience` = Defaults to `general`, telling them to use the default Jupyter settings. If `audience` is set to `student`, it gives more specific instructions.
- `docker_image` = Optional, it will tell them how to set the image.
- `startup_script` =  Optional, it will tell them how to set the script.
- `workspace_name` =  Optional, it will tell them which Workspace to use to launch Jupyter.
- `notebook_name` = Optional, it will tell them to open a specific Notebook

### Set audience to student, but don't specify details:

```
# Specify variables
AnVIL_module_settings <- list(
  audience = "student"
)

cow::borrow_chapter(
  doc_path = "child/_child_jupyter_launch.Rmd",
  repo_name = "jhudsl/AnVIL_Template"
)
```
